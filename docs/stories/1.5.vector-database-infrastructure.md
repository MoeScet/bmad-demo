## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
**Key learnings from Story 1.4:**
- SQLite/PostgreSQL compatibility patterns are important for testing environments
- Performance monitoring with structured logging is established standard
- Feature flags for rollback capability should be implemented
- Repository pattern with dependency injection follows existing architecture
- Response time budgets are critical (maintaining <2 second target for vector operations)

### Technical Infrastructure Context
**Technology Stack:** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Vector Database:** ChromaDB 0.4.15 - Python-native, simple deployment, open-source
- **Embeddings:** sentence-transformers 2.2.2 - Open-source, no API costs, proven performance
- **Cloud Platform:** Railway (Primary) with Render as backup option
- **Deployment:** Railway CLI and configuration files with Docker containers
- **Monitoring:** Better Stack Free Tier for uptime and error tracking

**Project Structure Alignment:** [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
- **Infrastructure Location:** `infrastructure/` directory for Railway/deployment configs
- **Docker Configuration:** `docker-compose.yml` for local development environment
- **Shared Libraries:** `shared/python/` for common vector database utilities
- **Service Pattern:** Follow existing service structure in `services/` directory

**Development Environment Standards:** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- **Response Time Budget:** Vector similarity search <2 second target (matching existing pattern)
- **Error Handling:** Catch specific exceptions, no bare `except:` clauses, log with correlation_id
- **Vector Database Isolation:** ChromaDB operations must be wrapped in try/catch with fallback responses
- **Environment Variables:** SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE with service prefix pattern
- **Async Patterns:** Use async/await for all I/O operations including vector database calls

**Database Integration:** [Source: architecture/database-schema.md]
- **Manual Content Table:** Already exists with embedding vector field for ChromaDB integration
- **PostgreSQL Extensions:** pg_trgm extension available for text search complementing vector search
- **Connection Pattern:** Follow existing database connection patterns with async SQLAlchemy

**Infrastructure Deployment:** [Source: architecture/infrastructure-and-deployment.md]
- **Deployment Strategy:** Railway preview deployments for staging, main for production
- **Environment Promotion:** Feature Branch → Staging (Railway Preview) → Production (Railway Main)
- **Health Checks:** Must implement health check endpoints following existing pattern
- **Rollback Strategy:** Railway's built-in deployment rollback with <5 minute recovery time

### Testing
**Testing Requirements:** [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]
- **Test Location:** Tests in `tests/` directory adjacent to `src/`, mirror source structure
- **Framework:** pytest 7.4.3 with asyncio support and fixtures
- **Integration Testing:** Use in-memory ChromaDB instance for vector operations testing
- **Performance Testing:** Automated performance testing with <2 second response time validation
- **Coverage Goal:** 90% line coverage for core business logic components
- **Mocking:** pytest-mock with unittest.mock for external dependencies
- **Test Data:** Factory pattern using factory_boy for realistic test embeddings and collections
