# Story 1.3: Fast Q&A Database System

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** system administrator,
**I want** a curated database of common washing machine troubleshooting solutions,
**so that** users can receive instant responses to frequently encountered problems.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. PostgreSQL database schema designed for Q&A pairs with metadata (keywords, machine models, complexity)
2. Initial dataset of 100 diverse washing machine troubleshooting Q&A pairs curated from manufacturer manuals
3. Fast lookup API endpoint implemented with keyword matching and response ranking
4. Database seed scripts created for consistent development environment setup
5. Q&A content validation to ensure responses include safety considerations and skill-appropriate instructions
6. Admin interface for Q&A content management (CRUD operations) accessible via simple web interface
7. Performance testing confirms sub-5 second response times for fast-path queries

- SQLAlchemy 2.0.23 with async support for database operations
- PostgreSQL 15.4 with full-text search using TSVECTOR for fast keyword matching
- Python 3.11.5 runtime with async/await pattern support for all I/O operations

**Service Architecture:** [Source: architecture/components.md]
- **Responsibility:** Sub-5 second lookup of curated troubleshooting solutions for common issues
- **Key Interfaces:** 
  - `POST /qa/search` - Keyword-based fast lookup
  - `GET /qa/entries` - Q&A content management
  - `POST /qa/entries` - Add new Q&A pairs (admin)
- **Dependencies:** PostgreSQL (QAEntry table), User Context Service for response adaptation
- **Technology Stack:** FastAPI 0.104.1, SQLAlchemy 2.0.23, full-text search with PostgreSQL tsvector

### Database Schema Context
**QA Entries Table:** [Source: architecture/database-schema.md]
```sql
CREATE TABLE qa_entries (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    question TEXT NOT NULL,
    answer TEXT NOT NULL,
    keywords TEXT[], -- Array for fast keyword matching
    search_vector TSVECTOR, -- Full-text search optimization
    supported_models TEXT[],
    safety_level VARCHAR(50) CHECK (safety_level IN ('safe', 'caution', 'professional')) DEFAULT 'safe',
    complexity_score INTEGER CHECK (complexity_score BETWEEN 1 AND 10) DEFAULT 5,
    success_rate DECIMAL(3,2) DEFAULT 0.0,
    usage_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,

### Critical Coding Standards
**Mandatory Requirements:** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- **Response Time Budget:** Fast Q&A service calls must have 3 second timeout maximum
- **Async/Await Pattern:** Use async/await for all I/O operations including database calls
- **Type Hints:** Complete type hints required including return types, use `from __future__ import annotations`
- **Pydantic Validation:** All API request/response models must use Pydantic BaseModel
- **Repository Pattern:** Use repository pattern with dependency injection for SQLAlchemy operations
- **Database Transactions:** All multi-table operations must use explicit transactions
- **Correlation ID:** Every service call must propagate correlation_id header for request tracing
- **Safety Classification:** All Q&A responses must include appropriate safety level classifications

**Environment Variables:** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- Use SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE with service prefix (e.g., `FAST_QA_DATABASE_URL`, `FAST_QA_TIMEOUT`)

### API Response Format
**Standard Format:** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- All API responses must use: `{data: ..., error: null}` or `{data: null, error: {...}}`
- No mixed success/error responses allowed

### Testing

**Testing Framework:** [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]
- pytest 7.4.3 with asyncio support for Fast Q&A service async operations
- Test files in `tests/` directory within fast-qa service, mirroring `src/` structure
- Coverage requirement: 90% for business logic, Q&A search and management operations

**Fast Q&A Service Testing Requirements:** [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]
- **Unit Tests:** Mock all database operations using pytest-mock with unittest.mock
- **Integration Tests:** Use Testcontainers with PostgreSQL 15 for realistic database testing
- **Performance Tests:** Validate sub-5 second response time requirement for all search operations
- **Factory Pattern:** Use factory_boy for generating realistic Q&A test data
- **Test Data:** Include realistic washing machine troubleshooting scenarios in test fixtures

**Test Organization:** [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]
- Unit tests: `services/fast-qa/tests/` mirroring source structure
- Integration tests: `tests/integration/test_fast_qa.py` in project root
- AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert) with descriptive test names
- Automatic database cleanup after each test using pytest fixtures
