# Story 1.6: Basic Manual Content Pipeline

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** system administrator,
**I want** a basic manual processing pipeline that can handle initial content loading,
**so that** Epic 2 semantic search has foundational content available from day one.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **Minimal PDF Processing**
   - Simple PDF text extraction using PyPDF2 for common washing machine manuals
   - Basic text cleaning and segmentation (paragraph-level chunks)
   - Error handling for corrupted or incompatible PDF files
   - Processing status tracking and basic logging
2. **Initial Content Loading**
   - Processing pipeline can handle 3-5 key manufacturer manuals (Whirlpool, LG, Samsung)
   - Text segments stored in PostgreSQL with basic metadata
   - Vector embeddings generated using sentence-transformers
   - Embeddings stored in ChromaDB with source attribution
3. **Admin Interface Integration**
   - Simple upload interface for PDF manuals
   - Processing status display (queued, processing, completed, failed)
   - Basic content review and approval workflow
   - Manual deletion and reprocessing capabilities
4. **Quality Assurance**
   - Text extraction quality validation (minimum readability threshold)
   - Duplicate content detection and handling
   - Manual content tagging (manufacturer, model series, content type)
   - Basic search accuracy validation against known queries

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
**Key learnings from Story 1.5:**
- ChromaDB HTTP API implementation provides better stability than Python client
- Dual implementation strategy (HTTP + Python client) ensures compatibility
- Async patterns with correlation ID propagation are established standard
- Health check endpoints with fallback responses are critical for service reliability
- Rancher Desktop compatibility confirmed for local development environment
- Performance targets consistently achieved <1 second (exceeds requirements)

### Technical Infrastructure Context
**Technology Stack:** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **PDF Processing:** PyPDF2 for text extraction (no external API costs)
- **Embeddings:** sentence-transformers 2.2.2 - Open-source, proven performance
- **Database:** PostgreSQL 15.4 with SQLAlchemy 2.0.23 async patterns
- **Vector Database:** ChromaDB 0.4.15 with HTTP API integration
- **Backend Framework:** FastAPI 0.104.1 with async support
- **Testing:** pytest 7.4.3 with asyncio support and fixtures

**Project Structure Alignment:** [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
- **Service Location:** `services/manual-processing/` for Manual Processing Pipeline
- **Service Pattern:** FastAPI app with `src/main.py` entry point
- **Structure:** `src/` directory with `api/`, `processing/`, `config/` subdirectories
- **Shared Libraries:** Use `shared/python/` for database utilities and models
- **Testing:** Mirror `src/` structure in adjacent `tests/` directory

**Database Schema Integration:** [Source: architecture/database-schema.md]
- **Manual Content Table:** Already defined with proper schema and indexes
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE manual_content (
      id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
      manufacturer VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
      model_series VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
      section_title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
      content TEXT NOT NULL,
      content_type VARCHAR(50) CHECK (content_type IN ('troubleshooting', 'maintenance', 'safety', 'warranty')),
      search_vector TSVECTOR,
      confidence_score DECIMAL(3,2) DEFAULT 0.0,
      source_manual VARCHAR(255),
      page_reference VARCHAR(50),
      created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
  );
  ```
- **Full-text Search:** pg_trgm extension available for text search optimization
- **Auto-indexing:** Triggers automatically update search_vector on content changes

**Coding Standards Compliance:** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- **Async Patterns:** Use async/await for all I/O operations (PDF processing, DB, ChromaDB)
- **Error Handling:** Catch specific exceptions, no bare `except:`, log with correlation_id
- **Response Time Budget:** Processing pipeline must complete within reasonable timeframes
- **Type Hints:** Complete type annotations for all functions and classes
- **Repository Pattern:** Use dependency injection pattern for database operations
- **Correlation ID:** Propagate correlation_id through all service calls

**Testing Requirements:** [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]
- **Test Location:** `tests/` directory adjacent to `src/`, mirror source structure
- **Framework:** pytest 7.4.3 with asyncio support and fixtures
- **Integration Testing:** Use Testcontainers with PostgreSQL 15 for realistic database testing
- **Vector Database Testing:** In-memory ChromaDB instance for vector operations testing
- **Coverage Goal:** 90% line coverage for core business logic components
