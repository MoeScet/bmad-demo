3. Diverse error selection to maximize coverage with limited fast-path slots
4. Manual search limited to top 3 semantically similar results
5. Pre-processing and optimization strategies for speed

#### Insights Discovered:
- Optimization through diversity rather than frequency alone
- Semantic similarity crucial for accuracy in constrained results
- Speed constraints drive architectural decisions

#### Notable Connections:
- Diversity strategy connects to comprehensive coverage goals
- Speed and accuracy must be balanced through smart architecture

### Role Playing - 20 minutes

**Description:** Exploring accuracy requirements from different user perspectives

#### Ideas Generated:
1. Complete novice needs simple instructions plus error explanations
2. DIY enthusiast wants concise, step-by-step information
3. Apartment renter/student needs ultra-simple, non-invasive fixes only
4. Context-aware relevance is part of accuracy
5. Communication style affects perceived accuracy
6. User capabilities determine actionable solutions

#### Insights Discovered:
- Accuracy is contextual - same information may be accurate for one user but not another
- Communication adaptation is part of delivering accurate help
- User constraints (rental, tools, skills) define what solutions are truly "accurate"

#### Notable Connections:
- User context and system transparency work together
- Simplicity principle applies differently across user types
