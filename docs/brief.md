# Project Brief: RAG-Powered Washing Machine Troubleshooting Assistant

## Executive Summary

We are developing an intelligent washing machine troubleshooting assistant that leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology to provide accurate, context-aware repair guidance directly within Microsoft Teams. The application addresses the frustrating experience of appliance breakdowns by instantly connecting users with precise troubleshooting steps from manufacturer manuals, delivering responses in under 10 seconds while maintaining safety and accuracy through innovative tiered search architecture and transparency features.

## Problem Statement

When washing machines break down, users face a frustrating cascade of problems that cost them time, money, and peace of mind. Currently, people experiencing appliance errors must navigate fragmented solutions: searching through dense PDF manuals, waiting hours or days for repair technicians, or risking expensive mistakes by attempting fixes without proper guidance.

The existing troubleshooting landscape fails users in critical ways:
- **Information Accessibility**: Manufacturer manuals are buried in downloads, poorly organized, and written in technical language that assumes expertise most users don't have
- **Speed vs. Accuracy Trade-off**: Quick online searches often yield generic advice that doesn't match specific error codes or models, while thorough manual research takes too long when you need clean clothes today
- **Context Blindness**: Current solutions don't account for user skill levels, available tools, or living situations (like renters who can't make certain modifications)
- **Safety Risks**: Without proper guidance, users may attempt repairs beyond their capabilities, creating safety hazards or voiding warranties

The urgency is real: appliance downtime disrupts daily life, and poor troubleshooting advice can turn a simple fix into an expensive service call. What's needed is instant access to accurate, contextually appropriate guidance that knows when to help and when to recommend professional intervention.

## Proposed Solution

We will create an intelligent RAG-powered troubleshooting assistant that combines the comprehensive knowledge of manufacturer manuals with innovative architectural solutions to deliver accurate, contextually appropriate repair guidance in under 10 seconds.

**Core Solution Architecture:**
- **Tiered Search System**: Lightning-fast Q&A lookup for the 100 most common washing machine errors, with semantic manual search as intelligent fallback for uncommon issues
- **Context-Aware Intelligence**: User skill detection and response adaptation ensuring instructions match capabilities (complete novice, DIY enthusiast, apartment renter constraints)
- **Transparency-First Design**: Proactive disclosure of supported machine models, system limitations, and clear "I don't know" responses when knowledge gaps exist
- **Safety Boundary Recognition**: Intelligent classification system that identifies when repairs require professional intervention, preventing dangerous DIY attempts

**Key Differentiators:**
- **Microsoft Teams Native Integration**: Users get help within their existing workplace communication flow, no app switching required
- **Meta-Accuracy Innovation**: System actively monitors and reports its own knowledge gaps, ensuring users know exactly what it can and cannot help with
- **Constraint-Optimized Speed**: Purpose-built architecture that delivers sub-10 second responses using only free tools, proving enterprise-quality AI doesn't require expensive infrastructure
- **Universal Simplicity**: Instructions assume only basic household tools and present solutions that work regardless of technical expertise level

This solution succeeds where others fail by treating accuracy as contextual rather than absolute—the same repair information becomes "accurate" or "inaccurate" based on user capabilities, available tools, and safety considerations.
