# RAG-Powered Washing Machine Troubleshooting Assistant Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
• Deliver accurate washing machine troubleshooting guidance within sub-10 second response times for 95% of user queries
• Enable 80% problem resolution rate without requiring professional service calls through contextually appropriate repair instructions
• Achieve 85%+ solution accuracy rate through intelligent user skill detection and response adaptation
• Establish safety boundary recognition system that prevents 100% of inappropriate DIY repair attempts
• Integrate seamlessly within Microsoft Teams environment to serve 500+ active users across 10+ organizations
• Maintain transparent communication about system capabilities, limitations, and supported machine models

### Background Context
The RAG-Powered Washing Machine Troubleshooting Assistant addresses the critical gap between appliance breakdown urgency and available support quality. When washing machines fail, users currently face fragmented solutions requiring manual research through dense PDFs, lengthy waits for technicians, or risky DIY attempts without proper guidance. This application leverages tiered search architecture combining lightning-fast Q&A lookup for common issues with semantic manual search fallback, delivering comprehensive manufacturer-sourced guidance adapted to user skill levels and safety constraints within existing workplace communication workflows.

The innovation centers on contextual accuracy recognition—understanding that the same technical information becomes "accurate" or "inaccurate" based on user capabilities, available tools, and living situation constraints. Through Microsoft Teams integration and transparency-first design, the system provides enterprise-quality AI assistance using only free-tier infrastructure while maintaining rigorous safety standards and user trust.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision
The troubleshooting experience should feel like consulting a knowledgeable colleague within Teams - conversational, reliable, and transparent about limitations. Users will engage through natural language queries and receive structured, actionable responses that clearly communicate both the solution and the reasoning behind safety recommendations. The interface prioritizes rapid comprehension over visual complexity, ensuring users can quickly identify next steps during stressful appliance failure situations.

### Key Interaction Paradigms
- **Conversational troubleshooting flow**: Users describe symptoms in natural language, system responds with clarifying questions when needed
- **Progressive disclosure**: Initial responses provide essential steps with option to request detailed explanations or alternative approaches
- **Transparent uncertainty**: System proactively communicates confidence levels and knowledge boundaries
- **Context-aware guidance**: Interface adapts complexity and safety warnings based on detected user skill level
- **Safety-first interruption**: Critical safety warnings interrupt normal flow with prominent visual treatment

### Core Screens and Views
- **Initial Query Interface**: Teams chat input with suggested example queries and supported machine model disclosure
- **Response Display**: Structured troubleshooting steps with embedded safety warnings and skill-level appropriate detail
- **Follow-up Interaction**: Quick action buttons for "This worked," "Need more detail," "Still not working" to capture success metrics
- **Safety Boundary Screen**: Prominent display when professional service is recommended with reasoning and referral guidance
- **Knowledge Gap Response**: Clear "I don't know" interface with suggestions for alternative resources or manual consultation

### Accessibility: WCAG AA
Meeting enterprise accessibility standards for Teams integration with focus on screen reader compatibility, keyboard navigation, and high contrast support for visual safety warnings.

### Branding
Minimal visual branding to integrate seamlessly within Teams environment. Clear visual hierarchy distinguishing safety warnings (high contrast, warning colors) from general instructions. Professional, trustworthy aesthetic that reinforces system reliability without competing with Teams UI patterns.

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
Primary support for Teams desktop and web clients with responsive design ensuring troubleshooting steps remain readable on mobile Teams apps during active repair work.

## Technical Assumptions
