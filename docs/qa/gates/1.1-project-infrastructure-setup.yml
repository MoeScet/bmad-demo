# Quality Gate Decision for Story 1.1: Project Infrastructure Setup
# Generated by Quinn (Test Architect) 
schema: 1
story: "1.1"
story_title: "Project Infrastructure Setup"
gate: CONCERNS
status_reason: "Infrastructure setup is comprehensive and well-executed but has database test fixture issues and timeout configuration inconsistencies that should be addressed."

# Issues found requiring attention
top_issues:
  - id: "TEST-001"
    severity: medium
    finding: "Database integration tests fail due to pytest-asyncio fixture configuration issues"
    suggested_action: "Fixed pytest-asyncio fixtures but tests still require PostgreSQL instance - recommend using testcontainers or skipping DB tests in CI until infrastructure is available"
  - id: "CONFIG-001"
    severity: medium
    finding: "Timeout configurations are inconsistent - ServiceTimeoutConfig defines different timeouts than what's mentioned in coding standards"
    suggested_action: "Align timeout values between ServiceTimeoutConfig and coding standards documentation"
  - id: "IMPORT-001"
    severity: low
    finding: "Teams bot main.py uses sys.path.insert() for shared modules instead of proper Python packaging"
    suggested_action: "Consider using proper Python packaging (setup.py/pyproject.toml) or relative imports for better maintainability"
