# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision
The troubleshooting experience should feel like consulting a knowledgeable colleague within Teams - conversational, reliable, and transparent about limitations. Users will engage through natural language queries and receive structured, actionable responses that clearly communicate both the solution and the reasoning behind safety recommendations. The interface prioritizes rapid comprehension over visual complexity, ensuring users can quickly identify next steps during stressful appliance failure situations.

## Key Interaction Paradigms
- **Conversational troubleshooting flow**: Users describe symptoms in natural language, system responds with clarifying questions when needed
- **Progressive disclosure**: Initial responses provide essential steps with option to request detailed explanations or alternative approaches
- **Transparent uncertainty**: System proactively communicates confidence levels and knowledge boundaries
- **Context-aware guidance**: Interface adapts complexity and safety warnings based on detected user skill level
- **Safety-first interruption**: Critical safety warnings interrupt normal flow with prominent visual treatment

## Core Screens and Views
- **Initial Query Interface**: Teams chat input with suggested example queries and supported machine model disclosure
- **Response Display**: Structured troubleshooting steps with embedded safety warnings and skill-level appropriate detail
- **Follow-up Interaction**: Quick action buttons for "This worked," "Need more detail," "Still not working" to capture success metrics
- **Safety Boundary Screen**: Prominent display when professional service is recommended with reasoning and referral guidance
- **Knowledge Gap Response**: Clear "I don't know" interface with suggestions for alternative resources or manual consultation

## Accessibility: WCAG AA
Meeting enterprise accessibility standards for Teams integration with focus on screen reader compatibility, keyboard navigation, and high contrast support for visual safety warnings.

## Branding
Minimal visual branding to integrate seamlessly within Teams environment. Clear visual hierarchy distinguishing safety warnings (high contrast, warning colors) from general instructions. Professional, trustworthy aesthetic that reinforces system reliability without competing with Teams UI patterns.

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
Primary support for Teams desktop and web clients with responsive design ensuring troubleshooting steps remain readable on mobile Teams apps during active repair work.
