## Critical Dependencies Resolved

### ðŸ”§ **Infrastructure Gap #1: Vector Database Timing**
- **BEFORE:** ChromaDB setup unclear, could delay Epic 2
- **AFTER:** Explicit Story 1.5 ensures vector database ready before Epic 2
- **RESULT:** Eliminates critical blocker for semantic search

### ðŸ”§ **Infrastructure Gap #2: Manual Content Availability**
- **BEFORE:** Manual processing in Epic 2 could delay all semantic search
- **AFTER:** Basic content pipeline in Story 1.6 provides foundation content
- **RESULT:** Epic 2 can implement advanced features with content available

### ðŸ”§ **Infrastructure Gap #3: API Management**
- **BEFORE:** Microsoft Teams app setup process unclear
- **AFTER:** Enhanced Story 1.2 with complete API management
- **RESULT:** Reduces risk of Teams integration delays

## Epic 1 Resource Impact

### **Timeline Changes:**
- **Original Epic 1:** 6-8 days
- **Enhanced Epic 1:** 10-12 days
- **Additional Investment:** 4 days
- **Risk Mitigation Value:** Eliminates 2 critical blockers + 1 medium risk

### **Story Count Changes:**
- **Original Stories:** 5
- **Enhanced Stories:** 8 (3 new)
- **Core Stories Enhanced:** 1 (Teams Bot Foundation)

### **Deliverables Added:**
1. **Functional ChromaDB Infrastructure** (Story 1.5)
