## Category Analysis Table

| Category                         | Status  | Critical Issues |
| -------------------------------- | ------- | --------------- |
| 1. Problem Definition & Context  | PASS    | None - comprehensive problem statement from Project Brief |
| 2. MVP Scope Definition          | PASS    | Well-defined boundaries and rationale |
| 3. User Experience Requirements  | PASS    | Complete UI/UX vision with Teams integration focus |
| 4. Functional Requirements       | PASS    | 12 comprehensive FRs with clear acceptance criteria |
| 5. Non-Functional Requirements   | PASS    | Performance, security, and reliability well-defined |
| 6. Epic & Story Structure        | PASS    | 4 logically sequenced epics with detailed stories |
| 7. Technical Guidance            | PASS    | Comprehensive technology stack and architecture |
| 8. Cross-Functional Requirements | PARTIAL | Data schema design specifics could be more detailed |
| 9. Clarity & Communication       | PASS    | Clear, well-structured documentation |

## Top Issues by Priority

**HIGH:**
- Data schema relationships between Q&A database, vector embeddings, and user context require more architectural detail
- Local testability requirements for admin interface stories need CLI or API testing specifications

**MEDIUM:**
- User research validation methodology could benefit from specific measurement approaches
- Manual content acquisition legal considerations need documentation

**LOW:**
- Some acceptance criteria could include more specific performance benchmarks
- Error handling edge cases could be expanded

## MVP Scope Assessment
- **Appropriately Sized**: The 4-epic structure delivers incremental value while remaining achievable
- **No Features to Cut**: All epics address core requirements from Project Brief
- **No Missing Essentials**: All Project Brief requirements covered across epics
- **Complexity Appropriate**: Epic 1 foundation enables iterative development
- **Timeline Realistic**: 4-6 week target achievable with proper execution

## Technical Readiness
- **Technical Constraints Clear**: Free-tier limitations and 10-second response targets well-defined
- **Architecture Direction Solid**: Microservices within monorepo approach appropriate
- **Risk Areas Identified**: Vector database performance, Teams integration complexity
- **Implementation Guidance**: Technology stack selections with clear rationale

## Recommendations

**Address Data Schema Detail (HIGH Priority):**
- Epic 1 Stories should include more specific database schema design in acceptance criteria
- Story 2.1 needs clearer vector database schema and metadata structure specifications

**Enhance Testing Specifications (HIGH Priority):**  
- Add CLI testing requirements for backend services in relevant story acceptance criteria
- Include specific performance testing methodologies for 10-second response validation

**Document Content Strategy (MEDIUM Priority):**
- Story 1.3 should include legal framework for manufacturer manual usage
- Story 2.1 needs content quality assurance process definition

## Final Decision

**âœ… READY FOR ARCHITECT**: The PRD and epics are comprehensive, properly structured, and ready for architectural design. The minor gaps identified are implementation details that can be refined during architectural planning rather than fundamental requirements issues.
