# Epic 3: Safety & Transparency Framework

**Epic Goal:** Build comprehensive safety boundary recognition system, knowledge gap disclosure, and transparent limitation communication to ensure user trust, prevent inappropriate repair attempts, and establish system as reliable, responsible troubleshooting assistant.

## Story 3.1: Safety Classification Engine
As a system user,
I want the system to automatically identify when repairs require professional intervention,
so that I am protected from attempting dangerous or complex repairs beyond my capabilities.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Safety classification system analyzes repair instructions and identifies professional-required tasks
2. Rule-based classification covers electrical work, gas connections, structural modifications, and warranty-voiding repairs
3. Classification integrates with both fast Q&A and semantic search results before response delivery
4. Safety warnings prominently displayed with clear reasoning and professional service recommendations
5. Classification system handles edge cases and defaults to professional recommendation when uncertain
6. Admin interface allows safety rule management and classification review with override capabilities
7. Testing validates 95% accuracy in flagging dangerous repairs across diverse troubleshooting scenarios

## Story 3.2: Knowledge Gap Recognition
As a Teams user,
I want the system to clearly communicate when it doesn't know the answer to my question,
so that I can seek appropriate alternative help instead of receiving unreliable guidance.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Confidence scoring system evaluates search result quality and identifies low-confidence responses
2. "I don't know" responses triggered when no suitable matches found or confidence below threshold
3. Alternative resource suggestions provided: manufacturer support, local repair services, manual consultation
4. Knowledge gap responses include specific reasons for uncertainty (unsupported model, unclear symptoms, etc.)
5. System tracks and reports knowledge gap patterns for continuous improvement
6. Clear distinction between "I don't know" and safety boundary "requires professional help" responses
7. User testing confirms gap recognition builds trust rather than reducing system utility

## Story 3.3: Supported Model Transparency
As a Teams user,
I want to know which washing machine models and brands the system can help with,
so that I have appropriate expectations about the assistance I'll receive.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Model coverage database tracks supported manufacturers and specific models in Q&A and manual content
2. Proactive model disclosure presented during initial user interaction and help commands
3. Model-specific responses indicate coverage level: full support, partial support, or unsupported
4. Coverage gaps clearly communicated with suggestions for manufacturer-specific resources
5. Admin interface manages model coverage information with update capabilities
6. Coverage transparency integrates with search orchestration to set appropriate user expectations
7. User feedback mechanism allows reporting of coverage gaps and accuracy issues

## Story 3.4: Limitation Communication System
As a Teams user,
I want to understand what the troubleshooting system can and cannot do,
so that I can use it effectively and seek alternative help when needed.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. System limitation disclosure covers scope boundaries: washing machines only, DIY repairs only, no warranty advice
2. Proactive limitation communication integrated into conversation flow without disrupting user experience
3. Contextual limitations presented based on query type and user skill level
4. Clear explanation of system methodology: manual-based guidance, not real-time diagnostics
5. Limitation messaging balances transparency with maintaining user confidence in system capabilities
6. Help documentation comprehensively covers system scope, methodology, and appropriate use cases
7. User testing validates limitation communication improves rather than reduces system adoption

## Story 3.5: Trust Building Interface
As a Teams user,
I want to feel confident in the troubleshooting guidance I receive,
so that I can follow instructions safely and effectively resolve my washing machine issues.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Source attribution prominently displays manufacturer manual references and confidence levels
2. Response formatting includes clear safety disclaimers and professional service recommendations
3. Confidence indicators help users assess reliability of guidance for their specific situation
4. Follow-up mechanisms allow users to request clarification or report unsuccessful solutions
5. Trust indicators integrate across all response types: fast Q&A, semantic search, and safety warnings
6. Visual design emphasizes safety warnings and professional recommendations through clear formatting
7. User feedback collection measures trust levels and identifies areas for transparency improvement
