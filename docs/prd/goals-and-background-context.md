# Goals and Background Context

## Goals
• Deliver accurate washing machine troubleshooting guidance within sub-10 second response times for 95% of user queries
• Enable 80% problem resolution rate without requiring professional service calls through contextually appropriate repair instructions
• Achieve 85%+ solution accuracy rate through intelligent user skill detection and response adaptation
• Establish safety boundary recognition system that prevents 100% of inappropriate DIY repair attempts
• Integrate seamlessly within Microsoft Teams environment to serve 500+ active users across 10+ organizations
• Maintain transparent communication about system capabilities, limitations, and supported machine models

## Background Context
The RAG-Powered Washing Machine Troubleshooting Assistant addresses the critical gap between appliance breakdown urgency and available support quality. When washing machines fail, users currently face fragmented solutions requiring manual research through dense PDFs, lengthy waits for technicians, or risky DIY attempts without proper guidance. This application leverages tiered search architecture combining lightning-fast Q&A lookup for common issues with semantic manual search fallback, delivering comprehensive manufacturer-sourced guidance adapted to user skill levels and safety constraints within existing workplace communication workflows.

The innovation centers on contextual accuracy recognition—understanding that the same technical information becomes "accurate" or "inaccurate" based on user capabilities, available tools, and living situation constraints. Through Microsoft Teams integration and transparency-first design, the system provides enterprise-quality AI assistance using only free-tier infrastructure while maintaining rigorous safety standards and user trust.
