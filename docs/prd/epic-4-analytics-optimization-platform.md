so that I can understand user behavior and optimize system capabilities.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Analytics system tracks query volume, response times, success/failure rates across all system components
2. User interaction patterns captured: skill level distribution, query types, follow-up behavior
3. Performance metrics dashboard displays real-time and historical system performance against targets
4. Search system analytics differentiate fast Q&A vs. semantic search usage and effectiveness
5. Safety classification analytics track warning frequency and user compliance patterns
6. Geographic and temporal usage patterns analyzed to optimize system availability and performance
7. Data export capabilities support detailed analysis and reporting for stakeholders

## Story 4.2: Accuracy Measurement Framework
As a product manager,
I want to measure and track troubleshooting accuracy across different user contexts,
so that I can validate system effectiveness and identify improvement opportunities.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. User feedback collection system captures resolution success rates and solution effectiveness
2. Follow-up survey mechanism measures user satisfaction and problem resolution outcomes
3. Accuracy tracking differentiates performance across user skill levels and query complexity
4. Context-aware accuracy measurement accounts for user constraints and capability limitations
5. Accuracy metrics integrated with confidence scoring to validate system self-assessment capabilities
6. Benchmark tracking against 85% accuracy target with automated alerting for performance degradation
7. Accuracy data analysis identifies patterns in failure modes and successful resolution strategies

## Story 4.3: Knowledge Base Optimization
As a content administrator,
I want insights into knowledge base performance and coverage gaps,
so that I can continuously improve troubleshooting content and system effectiveness.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Content performance analytics identify most/least effective Q&A pairs and manual sections
2. Knowledge gap analysis tracks patterns in "I don't know" responses and user feedback
3. Search result effectiveness measured through user interaction and success feedback
4. Content recommendation system suggests new Q&A pairs based on common unresolved queries
5. Manual coverage analysis identifies manufacturers and models requiring additional content
6. Content quality metrics track user ratings and effectiveness across different content sources
7. Automated content optimization suggestions based on user behavior and success patterns

## Story 4.4: System Performance Monitoring
As a system administrator,
I want comprehensive monitoring of system performance and reliability,
so that I can ensure consistent service delivery and proactively address issues.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Real-time performance monitoring tracks response times against 10-second target across all query types
2. System health dashboards monitor API endpoint availability, database performance, and service status
3. Error tracking and alerting system identifies and escalates system failures and performance issues
4. Resource utilization monitoring ensures free-tier infrastructure operates within limits
5. Capacity planning analytics project usage growth and infrastructure scaling requirements
6. Automated performance testing validates system performance under various load conditions
7. Performance optimization recommendations based on bottleneck analysis and usage patterns

## Story 4.5: Continuous Improvement Pipeline
As a product team,
I want automated systems that support continuous improvement of troubleshooting effectiveness,
so that the system becomes more valuable and accurate over time.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Improvement recommendation engine analyzes user feedback and performance data to suggest system enhancements
2. A/B testing framework supports experimentation with different response formats and content approaches
3. Machine learning pipeline identifies patterns in successful troubleshooting interactions
4. Automated content suggestion system recommends new Q&A pairs and manual content based on gap analysis
5. User behavior analysis identifies opportunities for interface and experience improvements
6. Success metric tracking validates improvement initiatives against business objectives
7. Improvement prioritization system ranks enhancement opportunities by potential impact and implementation effort
