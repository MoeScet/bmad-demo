# Epic 2: Intelligent Search & Context System

**Epic Goal:** Implement semantic search capabilities for manufacturer manual fallback, user skill level detection, and contextual response adaptation to provide comprehensive troubleshooting coverage that extends beyond fast-path queries while maintaining sub-10 second response targets.

## Story 2.1: Enhanced Manual Content Processing Pipeline
As a system administrator,
I want an enhanced automated system for ingesting and processing comprehensive manufacturer manuals,
so that users can access complete troubleshooting coverage beyond the basic content loaded in Epic 1.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. **Advanced PDF Processing**
   - Enhanced PDF processing with OCR support for scanned documents
   - Intelligent document structure recognition (table of contents, sections, chapters)
   - Multi-format support (PDF, Word documents, HTML manuals)
   - Advanced error handling and document validation
2. **Comprehensive Content Processing**
   - Advanced text preprocessing with entity recognition and technical term extraction
   - Intelligent content segmentation based on document structure and context
   - Metadata enrichment with advanced tagging (difficulty level, tool requirements, safety warnings)
   - Content deduplication and version management across manufacturers
3. **Scalable Processing Pipeline**
   - Processing pipeline handles 25+ manufacturer manuals with automated scaling
   - Batch processing capabilities for bulk manual uploads
   - Priority processing queue for high-demand manufacturers
   - Performance optimization for large document processing
4. **Advanced Quality Assurance**
   - Machine learning-based content quality scoring
   - Automated accuracy validation against known troubleshooting patterns
   - Content freshness tracking and update notifications
   - Advanced search relevance testing and optimization

**Story Dependencies:**
- Must complete after Story 1.6 (Basic Manual Content Pipeline)
- Builds upon foundational content processing established in Epic 1
- Enhances rather than replaces basic pipeline functionality

## Story 2.2: Semantic Search Engine
As a Teams user,
I want the system to find relevant troubleshooting information from manufacturer manuals when my query doesn't match the fast Q&A database,
so that I can get comprehensive help for uncommon or specific washing machine issues.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Semantic search API endpoint queries vector database using natural language input
2. Search results ranked by relevance with confidence scores and source attribution
3. Fallback system activates when fast Q&A lookup returns no suitable matches
4. Search performance optimized to return top 3 results within 15-second total response time
5. Results include manufacturer source, manual section, and confidence level in response
6. Integration testing validates seamless transition from fast-path to semantic search
7. Search accuracy tested against diverse query types (symptoms, error codes, model-specific issues)

## Story 2.3: User Skill Level Detection
As a Teams user,
I want the system to understand my technical skill level,
so that I receive appropriately detailed and safe troubleshooting instructions.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Skill detection system offers initial user profiling through simple interface questions
2. Three skill levels supported: complete novice, DIY enthusiast, apartment renter with constraints
3. User preferences stored in database with Teams user ID association for future sessions
4. Dynamic skill assessment based on conversation patterns and question complexity
5. Skill level override mechanism allows users to request different complexity levels per query
6. Detection system integrates with both fast Q&A and semantic search response systems
7. Testing validates appropriate response adaptation across all skill levels and query types

## Story 2.4: Contextual Response Adaptation
As a Teams user,
I want troubleshooting instructions tailored to my skill level and living situation,
so that I can follow guidance that's appropriate for my capabilities and constraints.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Response adaptation system modifies instruction complexity based on detected user skill level
2. Content filtering removes or emphasizes safety warnings based on user context and repair complexity
3. Tool and capability assumptions adjusted for apartment renters vs. homeowners vs. DIY enthusiasts
4. Alternative instruction paths provided when user constraints prevent standard repair approaches  
5. Response formatting adapts detail level: high-level steps for novices, technical details for enthusiasts
6. Contextual adaptation works for both fast Q&A responses and semantic search results
7. User testing validates that adapted responses improve comprehension and success rates

## Story 2.5: Integrated Search Orchestration
As a Teams user,
I want a seamless troubleshooting experience that automatically uses the best available information source,
so that I get comprehensive, contextually appropriate help without understanding system complexity.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Query orchestration system automatically determines optimal search strategy (fast vs. semantic)
2. Unified response formatting presents results consistently regardless of information source
3. Search confidence scoring guides user communication about result reliability
4. Follow-up conversation handling works across both search systems with maintained context
5. Performance monitoring ensures 95% of queries complete within 10-second target across all sources
6. Error handling gracefully manages search failures with appropriate fallback messaging
7. Integration testing validates end-to-end experience across all query types and user skill levels
